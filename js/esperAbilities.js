The mental effect being removed is suppressed as soon as the count begins, however, the effect resumes again immediately if the player is interrupted and the use of the ability is lost once it begins, even if interrupted. As long as at least one use of this ability is available you are always aware when you are under some sort of mental influence, but you will not automatically know the type of effect or how it was placed on you.",
