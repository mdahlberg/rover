Rule book page 3-4

For Core stats ONLY (mind body spirit) cost differences depending on level

So your planner starts at level 1, You assign whatever points you want (they can carry over)
Then you 'level up' and spend more points (optionally)

-----------------------------
Page 48
Essence = Magic

Slots get cheaper depending on your mind stat

level one bind slot - if you mind is 1 it costs 3, if your mind is 5 it costs 2

-----------------
Page 47
Magic is 'bottom heavy'
level 1 - you get 5 level 1 slots

pay attentiont to unnaceptable configuration

IF you want 5 level 9 slots, you will need 5 level 1-8 slots first (extreme)

{"proficiencies": [{"armor_destroyer": ["helm_crusher", "staggering_blows", "clear_the_way", "sword_breaker"]}, {"weighty_blows": ["body_blow", "strike_the_throat", "smite", "helm_crusher"}]}
